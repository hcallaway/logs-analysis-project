# Logs Analysis Project

This grouping of files -- specifically this README.md, analyze_logs.py, and Logs Analysis.txt -- is to satisfy the submission requirements for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree programs "Logs Analysis" project.

## How To Use
### Can run with Python 2.7 or Python 3.x
* Run the **analyze_logs.py** in the target directory, with access to database named **news**
* The program will output a **Logs Analysis** .txt file in the same directory
* Running the program again (without deleting Logs Analysis.txt) will replace contents of Logs Analysis.txt with updated information (if appropriate)
